Absolutely — here’s a **shortened bullet-style version** of what developers think about **REST APIs**, perfect for slides, quick briefs, or speaking points:

---

## ✅ Why Developers Like REST APIs

* 🌐 **Universal standard** — works with any frontend or platform.
* 🧠 **Easy to learn** — uses familiar HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).
* ⚙️ **Lightweight** — no extra libraries needed.
* 📈 **Scalable** — stateless nature allows load balancing and caching.
* 🔧 **Flexible** — can be built in any language or framework.

## ⚠️ Common Developer Complaints

* ❓ **Ambiguous design** — debates over when to use 200 vs 204, GET vs POST.
* 📚 **Docs can get messy** — large APIs need strong versioning and maintenance.
* 🐢 **Over-fetching** — sometimes pulls more data than needed.
* 🔁 **Not real-time** — REST isn't suited for live updates or streaming.
* 🧩 **Too many endpoints** — complex APIs can get bloated fast.
